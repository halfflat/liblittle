**Header-only containers and algorithms for small data structures.**

## Motivation

STL semantics are convenient, but the STL containers, while having good asymptopic
behaviour, can exhibit considerable overhead for small sizes when compared with
alternative na√Øve implementations.

Other times, one might want to minimise heap access, and instead use a container
of compile-time size or capacity.

The containers here are designed to have low overhead when the number of elements are
'small'; if they are more efficient or not in any given application though will
depend very much on how they are used and on the nature of the target platform.

## Contents

So far, just one container type and one algorithm:


### `small_multiset` and `tiny_multiset`

`small_multiset` implements the C++ UnorderedAssociativeContainer concept with
the following omissions:

1.  No `equal_range()` method,
2.  No `hash_function()` method,
3.  No `emplace_hint()` method.

It uses a `std::vector` as a backing store, and offers fast O(1) inserts and
slower O(*N*) find and count operations. For sufficiently small *N*, this may
still offer time or space advantages over a tree, hash or sorted-array
implementation.

`tiny_multiset` is a multiset with capacity fixed at compile-time, backed by
an array of uninitialised storage. It does not perform heap allocations, and
correspondingly does not have an allocator nor a `get_allocator()` method.

### `smallsort`

The `smallsort` header offers two templated functions `small_sort` and
`small_sort_inplace` that use sorting networks for sorting random-access
collections (really, anything supporting [] indexing) of fixed size.

Optimal sorting networks are used up to size 6; larger networks are
constructed recursively. These sorts will likely be much more
efficient than a generic sorting routine for arithmetic types when
the compiler can produce branchless min and max operations.
